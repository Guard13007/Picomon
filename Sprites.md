# Sprites

I will have 128 sprites available (I want maximum map space available.)

Sprites needed:

- Player (9 or 7 sprites)
  - 2 for each movement direction
    - (may be able to save 2 sprites by using horizontal flip on left/right)
  - Swimming state
- Stairs (2 sprites) (these teleport the player)
  - Dark background
  - Light background
- Chair (walk-through)
- Table (4 sprites) (2x2)
- Ground (8 or 9 sprites)
  - Grass
  - Plain white
  - Tile flooring
  - Dead grass
  - Cliff
  - Dirt
  - Rough dirt ?
  - Tall grass
  - Carpet
- Bed (2 sprites)
- Sign
- Gate
- Rock
- People (X sprites)
  - At least X unique types
- Fencing (2 sprites)
  - "trash bin" style
  - "poles" style
- Wall (2 sprites)
  - "window" style
  - Regular walling
- Decoration (10 sprites)
  - TV / Monitor
  - Gaming console
  - Desk with keyboard on it
  - Bookshelf (2 sprites)
  - Plant (2 sprites)
  - Phone
  - Fruit tree (2 sprites)
- Items (2 sprites)
  - "picoball" style
  - "rare candy" style
- Water tiles (13 or 9 sprites) (walk-through with appropriate item)
  - 4 sides
  - 4 corners
  - Full tile
  - 4 inner corners (not strictly needed)
- Boardwalk (2 sprites) (horizontal / vertical) (walk-through)
- Buildings (12 or 14 sprites)
  - 4x3 sprites
  - Note to self: Picomarts/Picocenters if possible, else 2 extra sprites for Picostops
- Picomon types (4 sprites)
  - Fire, water, earth, air
- Picomon (Y sprites)
  - At least Y unique types

0th sprite should maybe be an arrow symbol used in text or something like that, because it will never render in the map.

With the current listing, the minimum number of sprites needed is 70 + X + &. The maximum number of sprites needed is 79 + X + Y. I have 127 sprites available to me (1 through 127) (0 may be useful for a special sprite of non-map use). This means 48 sprites are available at a minimum for people/Picomon, and future expansion.

What do I want more of?

- Badges
- Items
- Signs? Different buildings?
- More terrain?
- People?
- Picomon?
